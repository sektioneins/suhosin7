Preamble
--------

Suhosin7 is in part based on original PHP code, which is licensed under
the PHP License (see below). In order to make it as simple as possible,
Suhosin7 is licensed under the PHP License version 3.01, too, where applicable
and not otherwise stated within the source code.

Note:
  * Some parts of the PHP License are not applicable to non-PHP code. Whenever
    this is the case, a common sense interpretation of the clause in question
    should be applied. One interpretation of such a license is included below.

  * The Mersenne Twister random number generator included in Suhosin7
    comes with its own license. See execute_rnd.c for details.
