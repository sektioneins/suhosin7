## Future plans (2019) and Suhosin-NG

Suhosin7 development has been suspended for quite some time now. But during that time, a lot of ideas came to mind on how to improve PHP security. With [Suhosin-NG](https://github.com/sektioneins/suhosin-ng) plans are on their way to explore some of these ideas based on the fabulous work done with snufflepagus.
